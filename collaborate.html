                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is one of my newer lessons as collaboration is more prevelant once you expand beyond the bounds of the University. 
                    It still happens all the time though within UofSC where any number of professors will help another in the same or different school. In my experiece, 
                    it was difficult to get help from other professors when it was not my field of study. I was often overlooked as an overeager student who was overly ambitious. 
                    I mean who could blame them? I was incoherent when I spoke computer modeling with gaps of knowledge I had yet to understand. 
                    When signing up for a dual degree, an exploratory advisor deemed I was in over my head. I actually needed to find the dual degree sign up myself hidden 
                    in the archives of old forms on the university website. It was to their suprise that I was in the new major workshop.

                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is easy to show when collaboration did not exist, but when it did it almost seemed as though it was natural. At a recent 
                    cross paper talk with Dr. Senner and Dr. Dallas labs, we discussed the benefit for the combination of theoretical and empirical ecology. This is basically 
                    the divide between mathematical formulations of the environment and measuring field observations. It should be a balance of the two, but far too often due to 
                    inexperience in advanced math, ecologist seem to overlook fundamental ecological theory papers. It is a necessity that we improve the bridging of these divides to 
                    encourage innovation in a combination of different schools of thought.
