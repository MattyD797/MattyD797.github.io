                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThroughout college, there has always been the consistent theme of initiative. Initiative is hard to define because it takes on different forms. 
                    On one hand you hear often that "you should take the initiative to achieve", but no one really explains, gives an example, or defines the word for you. I think it is a difficult 
                    topic to teach and learn because it requires motivation and a passion. It depends on a person finding what is important to them and growing that desire of wanting to do or learn 
                    more into something productive to one's goals. For me, this initiative is defined by goign beyond what is expected and to prove to yourself that you are more 
                    capable than originally percieved. Initiative is defined by growth and the courage to undertake possible failures.

                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn research, it is a common theme: failure. I will ask a question to further explore my interests and often times not reach a conclusion, yet another question. 
                    It may be a failure in the sense I did not answer my original question, however, I found a new path to follow. When I started research freshman year I was confused on 
                    what I wanted to do. I was tossing up ideas, such as becoming a veterinarian, doctor, entrepreneur, or a marine biologist. I started joining as many clubs, organizations, and
                    most importantly research opportunities to find what I found interesting while also making a good start on campus. I started off as a student researcher in the Mousseau Lab under 
                    Dr. Timothy Mousseau.

                <p>
                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspInitially, I started off with a project that at face value seemed incredibly interesting. I was to assess the abundance and occupancy of
                    mammalian species around Chernobyl's nuclear site. This is the site where in 1986 one of the nuclear reactors in the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded, releasing 
                    radiation across western Europe. Being that the effect to which this radiation has had on the surrounding environment, Mousseau's lab set out camera traps to measure the 
                    relative occupancy of mammals in the area. As this initially seemed like an awesome project, it was inhibited by more than 2 million images needed to be processed. This meant 
                    that I was suppose to tediously count the number and type of animals in each image. I realized that this was unreasonable even with the 8 undergraduate research assitants on hand. 
                    Therefore, I proposed an alternative solution to create a computer model to do it for me which can be seen in my publication below.
