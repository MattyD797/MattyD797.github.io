                <h2 style="margin-left: 100px;">Background</h2>
                <p>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhile at South Carolina, I have been involved with several laboratories off and on campus with diverse 
                    and different missions. I have integrated my own mission to implement strong computational applications into empirical ecology 
                    projects while producing products in the form of presentations, publications, and repositories. I often recognize a pattern 
                    of difficulty in balancing the fields of theoretical and empirical ecology, but have a strong desire to continue constructing 
                    this necessary bridge. I find it necessary for someone with my diverse interests to expand myself past a defined ecological problem, 
                    but challenge myself in model construction across a diverse set of data types and ecological scenarios. 
                </p>
                <h2 style="margin-left: 100px;">Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As offshore energy expands across the U.S. exclusive economic zone, federal regulatory agencies and industry 
                    are using rapidly advancing sensing technologies for environmental compliance under NEPA and protected species mitigation. Passive 
                    acoustic monitoring (PAM) has become a significant contributor to the success of marine protected species by providing an autonomous 
                    platform for evaluating dynamic stressors. However, remote sensing approaches like PAM are inhibited in identifying species-specific 
                    fish vocalizations.
                </p>
                <h2 style="margin-left: 100px;">Problem Solution</h2>
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAudio-video classification of species offers a solution but has been limited to the sample of fish that vocalize in direct sight of a 
                    standard camera. Utilizing a first-of-its-kind system of surround video and a compact acoustic array, I will identify the source of 
                    the sounds in the marine soundscape and visually classify the species. The addition of visual confirmation will identify the sound 
                    source of specific bioacoustic events, such that those acoustic events can later be used for evaluating ecosystem health from 
                    longer-term PAM surveys. To limit observational bias, enhance efficiency, and identify multidimensional relationships on fish acoustic 
                    behavior, a convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble would classify species of interest and pair specific vocalizations. Thus, fish
                     communication would become an autonomous means in inferring relationships with potential vulnerabilities on coastal ecosystems. These 
                     vulnerabilities include increasing water temperatures, development of offshore infrastructure, disease proliferation, and congested 
                     shipping lanes. Furthermore, as species and their sounds are discovered, the construction of sound libraries will revolutionize the 
                     evaluation of PAM to the resolution of species.</p>

                                    Let data collect over the year to allow ample time to build a strong foundation in the database construction and generalization. 
                                    This will give me a well rounded data base to create a model that can autonomously identify species in video
                                    and localize audio data to possible vocalizations. Model type may be experimental, but I will initially try a type of convolutional neural 
                                    network model ensemble.

                                    After model construction, I can store a library of known fish vocalizations to specific species. This library synthesis can then be transferred
                                    to spin off studies and be utilized in expanding the libraries.

                                <p style = "padding-top: 30px;">
                                    Since acoustic data has been collecting for a long time, we can further investigate the health of an ecosystem by matching sounds to specific fish species. 
                                    This can help us to identify fish occupancy and estimate abundance without visual confirmation in remote or high turbidity areas. An important tool
                                    for conservation organizations looking for a dynamic method to assess ecosystem health.

                                <p style = "padding-top: 30px;">
                                    Because we would only have fish in the environemtn where we initially tested and developed this method, we will have to expand this system to other environments. 
                                    This could lead to new key stone species being identified in determine environmental health and would be an important tool in identifying new anthropogenic marine initiative 
                                    effects. This includes shipping, energy development, and fishing that results in disease proliferation and population declines.

                <h2 style="margin-left: 100px;">Significance</h2>

                <p>
                    Upon successful CNN construction and matching biological sounds to identified species, fish bioacoustics could revolutionize our understanding of 
                    ecological stressors, such as mitigating impacts of renewable energy development on coastal ecosystems. Inferring acoustic communication events provides 
                    management organizations with the tools to quickly adapt to vulnerabilities that have significant economic and environmental impacts on our nation.
