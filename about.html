                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI am an undergraduate at the University of South Carolina and was elected into the Honors College to pursue a 
                        B.S. in Biological Sciences and Computer Sciences. Starting freshman year, the time has flown by with many more 
                        successes and opportunities than I can count. From failing, such as breaking my hand in intramural soccer, to major successes, like 
                        being a 2021 Goldwater Scholar, I learned every step of the way what kind of person I wished to be and what I wanted out of 
                        my future. I want to be a computational ecologist that utilizes machine learning and artificial intelligence applications to help answer 
                        some our worlds most challenging ecological problems. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI came as a freshman, open to learning new things. I grew up on the coast of North Carolina in a little known 
                        beach town in the center of Bogue Island. While not well known to the general public by other than a tourist location, it is an ecological 
                        hotspot for marine, avian, and terrestrial life. NC state, University of North Carolina, and Duke have their marine laboratories protected by
                        this sliver of land, known as a barrier island. Growing up in this area, I had the opportunity to experience some of nature's wonders first hand
                        which has driven me to carry this passion of ecology at the Univeristy of South Carolina as a prospective biology major.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor a year, I was satisifed on this route of taking a general major in biology as I had not figured out what I really wanted to 
                        do with it after graduation. It felt safe and normal to continue this standard pathway and would have most likely have made no significant difference in my current 
                        position of wanting to pursue gradaute school. But while I was sitting in my doctors appointment for a general checkup for my Type 1 diabetes (T1D) which I have had since 
                        seven, I had a change of plans. T1D is an autoimmune disorder that affects my mental, physical, and intellectual well-being from not having insulin producing beta cells to naturally control my blood sugar. 
                        My current mood or personality can change unpredictably when my blood sugar levels are not controlled. My doctor had recommended I upgrade my insulin pump to one that
                        included an AI control feature. After recognizing a drastic change in my sugars and having a knack for numbers, I began to realize how intertwined my life had become with 
                        computers. It became a skill that I could apply to my passions within ecology and is the reason why I added Computer Science as a dual degree. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Since developing this passoin and the skills to pursue it, I grew a strong connection to being involved in research. I started univeristy research early
                        in the Mousseau Lab with Dr. Timothy Mousseau. I began on a project studying how ecosystems are affected by nuclear radiation disasters. From this initial project, it spawned 
                        propositions for other ecological questions I wanted to answer and exposed a problem to me which I had taken personal responsibility on to find a solution. More about this solution
                        can be found under <b> <a href="initiative.html">initiative</a> </b>in key insights. From there, I got an internship to study nutrient fluxes, such as nitrgen, nitrate, phosphate, 
                        and chlorophyl a, that impact estuaries around the United States at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. I had the chance to develop my own model to predict high resolution
                        nutrient cycles and provide them a tool to further investigate how these cycles are unique and dynamic within estuaries. More on this project can be found within 
                        <b>  <a href="collaborate.html">collaborate</a> </b> under key insights. Finally, I was offered a project to study shorebird nesting behavior with geolocators. Utilizing only the
                        positions of an individual every few minutes to hours (depending on the type of geolocator), I am synthesizing a model to classify nesting behavior, such as incubation, foraging, 
                        or chick-tending. This information could prove valuable amongst shorebird researchers, in understanding how many nests were successful in a given year. More information about 
                        this project can be found within<b>  <a href="leadership.html">mentorship</a> </b> under key insights. From these experiences, I recieved a national scholarship, 
                        the Barry Goldwater Scholarship, the most prestigious undergraduate scholarship in the natural scineces, mathematics, and engineering in America.

                        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I pursued a lot of achievements in research, although it has been important for me to stay in touch with my hobbies and network with my peers who have
                        similar interests. Much of my focus and hobbies are centered around sustainability which includes the environment and socially through voluneering for organizations that help those less fortunate than me 
                        and my community. One of these organization is Sustainable Carolin. My duties have been
                         to improve sustainability on campus events and offices. Through talking with city level officials to 
                        campus execuatives, I have had the opportunity to discuss more friendly alternatives when planning sustainable events. I have carried this love of the environment
                        by cofounding my own campus organization called USC herpatology club to show why I love walking through the woods. Throughout the semesters I plan excursions with members to 
                        search for small critters, such as lizards, turtles, and frogs, in the Congaree National Forests and State Parks.
